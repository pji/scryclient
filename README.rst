Scrycli
=======

Scrycli is a partial client for the Scryfall.com API. Scryfall.com is a 
search engine for information on Magic: The Gathering cards and sets. 
This was built for me to explore building unit tests for an API 
client, though I may eventually include it in my MtG card collection 
database solution.

This work is in no way done with the knowledge or endorsement of the 
fine folks at Scryfall.com. References to that site are done for the

to imply the approval or endorsement of that site or anyone involved 
with it.

Contributing
------------
You want to contribute to this? First off, wow, that's awesome! 
I'm very honored by your interest. Secondly, I'm just experimenting 
here, so I don't know how to handle contributions properly. I'll 
try and figure it out as we go, but, if it feels like I'm clueless 
and doing it wrong, I probably am.
